	L'éclatement de la Horde en plusieurs dizaines de plus petits groupes face à une Union plus unifiée que jamais permit l'installation d'une paix prolongée.
	Aucun de ces groupuscules ne disposait d'une force capable d'ébranler cette nation s'affirmant désormais comme la plus grande force du continent.<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vous avez été envoyé dans la capitale de Zerotalis, capitale de l'Union Blanche. Votre présence est secrète: vous êtes en mission.
	Vous devez y déployer un insidieux et subtil logiciel, infecter un par un noeuds de contrôle cybernetique de la ville à l'aide du plus puissant virus
	de l'histoire. Une fois que toutes les installations de l'Union Blanche seront touchés, leurs défenses automatiques seront incapable de faire face à un assault d'envergure.<br />
